# TV Series Award Ontology

## Overview

The TV Series Award Ontology provides a structured framework to model the domain of TV series and the awards associated with them. This ontology is expressed in OWL (Web Ontology Language) and aims to capture detailed information about TV series, including their episodes, seasons, roles, and accolades, such as nominations and awards won.

## Namespace

The ontology is available under the namespace URI:  
`http://www.semanticweb.org/TvSeriesAwardOntology#`

## Features

- **Classes and Properties**: Includes comprehensive modeling of TV series, roles (actors, directors, producers), awards, and nominations.
- **Relationships**: Detailed object properties linking series to their episodes, seasons, associated personnel, and the awards they've won or been nominated for.
- **Interoperability**: Aligns with existing ontological standards and integrates well with other data sources and ontologies.

## Usage

This ontology can be used by researchers and developers interested in analyzing TV series data, developing applications that recommend TV series based on awards and nominations, or enhancing metadata management systems for digital libraries.
